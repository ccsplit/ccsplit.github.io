Currently I&amp;rsquo;m a security consultant for Depth Security and have assisted with the CTF for BSidesKC for the past three years.
As an employee of Depth I help maintain several projects including armory, which was created to automate and assist with running multiple tools against targets and gathering the information within a database to easily create reports.</description></item></channel></rss>
